How an URL get converted into an IP address that your computer can understand?
The answer is TCP/IP protocol called DNS(Domain Name System)

## DNS
DNS allows us to ask a special server to give us the IP address of the website we're trying to access. 

Example -> If we made a request to www.google.com our server would first send a request to a special DNS server(which your computer knows how to find). The server would then go looking for the IP address for Google and send it back to us. Our computer could then send the request to the IP of the Google Server.
