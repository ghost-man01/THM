# Traceroute
Traceroute can be used to map the path your request takes as it heads to the target machine.
Internet is made up of many-many different servers and end-points, all networked up each other. 
Traceroute allows you to see every intermediate step between your computer and the resource you requested. 
**Syntax -> `traceroute <destination>`**

By  default the Windows traceroute utility (tracert) operates using the same ICMP protocol that uses ping utilises, and the UNIX equivalent operates over UDP. This can be altered with switches in both instance.
